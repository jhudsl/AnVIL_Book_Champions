An AnVIL Champion serves as a point person within a community (institution, consortium, research group, geographic region, etc.) who can be a local resource for people interested in using AnVIL. AnVIL Champions help people in their community to understand the benefits of AnVIL, get started using the platform, and find appropriate resources for learning more. They also help AnVIL better meet the needs of their community by communicating feedback to the AnVIL team. An AnVIL Champion does not need to be an expert on all things AnVIL! Primarily, they need to be able to direct people to appropriate resources for finding help, and to serve as a local knowledge store for any community-specific considerations. Examples of ways in which AnVIL Champions can help their community include: Helping new users get started: Help new AnVIL users think through setting up their teams, and direct them to AnVIL’s Getting Started resources Also provide advice about community-specific considerations, such as explaining an institution’s preferred billing mechanism Guiding users to resources for learning more: Help community members find and navigate to the broad collection of resources for learning more about how to use AnVIL for their specific needs Pointing users towards support channels: Help community members get answers to their specific questions by directing them towards existing channels for receiving help on AnVIL Communicating feedback: Gather feedback from your community and communicate it to the AnVIL team Also guide community members to appropriate communication channels if they wish to provide feedback directly to the AnVIL team Here is what AnVIL Champions’ interactions might look like: Sam is an AnVIL Champion in a research consortium and works closely with an analyst, Alex. Alex messages Sam on Slack to ask about running a workflow on AnVIL. Sam responds by pointing to existing AnVIL tutorials and explains the consortium’s billing preferences. Sam isn’t an expert on workflows, and directs a few specific questions to the AnVIL team through help.anvilproject.org. 1.1 What do you need to be an AnVIL Champion? Basic understanding of AnVIL Comfort with new technology Willingness to help new users 1.2 Why be an AnVIL Champion? Targeted training opportunities Streamlined communication with support and developers Help your community CV / badge e.g. “Served as AnVIL Champion for Consortium X May 2024 - present” 1.3 Current Champions AnVIL Champions are listed on the AnVIL portal page.

As an AnVIL Champion, you can help new users by: 3.1 Discussing Team Configuration There are several decisions that need to be made when setting up a new group on AnVIL. These can be challenging for new users because they are unfamiliar with the vocabulary and unclear on the implications of their decisions. As an AnVIL Champion, you can help by being familiar with the decisions faced by new users and helping people think through how to set up their team. Here are some points that people will need to consider when setting up their group(s) on AnVIL: Billing Account – What Google Billing Account will you use? Note that a Billing Account is required to store data, conduct analysis, etc. Cost Monitoring – Who will monitor spending? Will this person be able to monitor daily/weekly? Team Management – Who will oversee the onboarding and offboarding of members? Will this person track the manifest of workspaces? Data Access – Which datasets will you be generating or analyzing? Do you already have access to these datasets? Data Analysis – Which tools will you need to do your analysis? Are these already Docker-ized / WDL-ized? If these are new to you, don’t worry! The AnVIL team will train you. 3.2 Directing People to Resources The Getting Started on AnVIL book is a great resource for new users that walks them step-by-step through setting up their group. See Learn More and Get Help for additional resources. 3.3 Explaining Community-Specific Considerations Most communities will have some specific considerations that people should be aware of when working on AnVIL. As an AnVIL Champion, you can help by being the local expert on common questions and concerns for your community. These can include things like: Preferred billing mechanism: Do individual groups handle their own billing, or is there e.g. an institutional agreement with Google Cloud Platform or a third-party reseller? Cost reporting requirements: What, if any, reports need to be submitted, what information should they include, and what’s the easiest way to get that out of GCP? Is there someone who needs to be added to the Billing Account so that they can view the GCP spending reports? Data and tools: Where do people find and access the data and tools they need to carry out their research? If your community is centered around a particular type of data or field of research, then there may be some common datasets and analysis tools that will be broadly useful to members of the community. You can help your community by explaining where these are maintained, how to import them into AnVIL Workspaces, and where to look for help if they are having problems. Security: If your community regularly works with sensitive or protected data, you can help new users comply with security requirements by explaining common community practices and by connecting them with other members of the community who have dealt with similar concerns and may be able to give them guidance. You don’t need to be able to answer every question that comes your way! Sharing your experience of getting started on AnVIL and your choices for setting up your team are a valuable starting point for new users. You can be incredibly helpful by being able to answer some of the most common questions that come up within your community, and by making sure your community members are aware of any local requirements for working with AnVIL.

"],["help.html", "5 Get Help", " 5 Get Help As an AnVIL Champion, your job is not to answer every question about AnVIL. You can help people find answers to their specific questions by directing them towards existing channels for receiving help on AnVIL. If people have questions, there are a few places they can go to get help: AnVIL Support Forum: The AnVIL Support forum is always available, and the AnVIL team regularly monitors the support forum and responds to questions. By posting in the support forum, other AnVIL users can also benefit from the questions and responses. AnVIL Demos: ~Monthly 30-min Zoom demonstration followed by open Q&amp;A provides an opportunity for live interactions with members of the AnVIL team. "],["communicate.html", "6 Communicate Feedback", " 6 Communicate Feedback An important part of being an AnVIL Champion is to communicate feedback from your community to the AnVIL team. AnVIL Champions serve as our real-life quality control by helping us understand the needs and challenges of their community. As you help your community members navigate AnVIL, take note of what people find confusing or frustrating and what tools, guides, or features they feel are missing, and let us know! You can help with this by communicating with the AnVIL team yourself, as well as by directing members of your community towards communication channels where they can contact us themselves.
