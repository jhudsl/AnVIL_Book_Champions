# Communicate Feedback {#communicate}

An important part of being an AnVIL Champion is to communicate feedback from your community to the AnVIL team. AnVIL Champions serve as our real-life quality control by helping us understand the needs and challenges of their community. As you help your community members navigate AnVIL, take note of what people find confusing or frustrating and what tools, guides, or features they feel are missing, and let us know!

You can help with this by communicating with the AnVIL team yourself, as well as by directing members of your community towards communication channels where they can contact us themselves. We encourage open communication through

- Posting in the [AnVIL Support forum](http://help.anvilproject.org)
- Contacting one of the [Working Groups](https://anvilproject.org/team/working-groups)
