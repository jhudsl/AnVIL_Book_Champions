## Launching Jupyter

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

:::{.warning}
AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers. It's very important that you select a cloud computing environment appropriate to your needs to avoid runaway costs.  If you are uncertain, start with the default settings; it is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down.
:::

Note that, in order to use Jupyter, you must have access to a Terra Workspace with permission to compute (i.e. you must be a "Writer" or "Owner" of the Workspace).

1. Open Terra - use a web browser to go to [`anvil.terra.bio`](https://anvil.terra.bio/)

1. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to "Workspaces". Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click "Workspaces".

The &quot;hamburger&quot; button to extend the drop-down menu is highlighted, and the menu item &quot;Workspaces&quot; is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of Terra drop-down menu.  The &quot;hamburger&quot; button to extend the drop-down menu is highlighted, and the menu item &quot;Workspaces&quot; is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. Click on the name of your Workspace. You should be routed to a link that looks like: `https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/<billing-project>/<workspace-name>`.

1. Click on the cloud icon on the far right to access your Cloud Environment options.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1-IU5l40UxmpoBqFimSUmT1PNEUij2UnXMslOsiG5ncE_g14ea2db115d_0_22.png" title="Screenshot of a Terra Workspace. The cloud icon to create a new cloud environment is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of a Terra Workspace. The cloud icon to create a new cloud environment is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. In the dialogue box, click the "Settings" button under Jupyter.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1-IU5l40UxmpoBqFimSUmT1PNEUij2UnXMslOsiG5ncE_g14ea2db115d_0_18.png" title="Screenshot of the Cloud Environment Details dialogue box. The Settings button under Jupyter is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Cloud Environment Details dialogue box. The Settings button under Jupyter is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. You will see some configuration options for the Jupyter cloud environment, and a list of costs because it costs a small amount of money to use cloud computing.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1-IU5l40UxmpoBqFimSUmT1PNEUij2UnXMslOsiG5ncE_g25442045568_0_0.png" title="Screenshot of the Jupyter Cloud Environment dialogue box. The cost to run the environment is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Jupyter Cloud Environment dialogue box. The cost to run the environment is highlighted." width="100%" />



1. Configure any settings you need for your cloud environment.  If you are uncertain about what you need, the default configuration is a reasonable, cost-conservative choice.  It is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down. Scroll down and click the "CREATE" button when you are satisfied with your setup.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1-IU5l40UxmpoBqFimSUmT1PNEUij2UnXMslOsiG5ncE_g14ea2db115d_0_41.png" title="Screenshot of the Jupyter Cloud Environment dialogue box. The &quot;CREATE&quot; button is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Jupyter Cloud Environment dialogue box. The &quot;CREATE&quot; button is highlighted." width="100%" />

    

    

    

    

    

    

1. The dialogue box will close and you will be returned to your Workspace.  You can see the status of your cloud environment by hovering over the Jupyter icon.  It will take a few minutes for Terra to request computers and install software.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1-IU5l40UxmpoBqFimSUmT1PNEUij2UnXMslOsiG5ncE_g25442045568_0_60.png" title="Screenshot of a Terra Workspace.

## Video overview on using Galaxy


Here is a video tutorial that describes the basics of using Galaxy on AnVIL.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16QEY8x-gBsUkKEeO3w_H-I4SLIBPloXd/preview" width="640" height="360" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

### Objectives

- Start compute for your Galaxy on AnVIL
- Run tool to quality control sequencing reads
- Stop compute to minimize expenses

### Slides

The slides for this tutorial are are located [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yYCg4cPVBMMDghT17B4XzROieqyMH99Ex9nMm_Scm9Q).

## Starting Galaxy

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

Note that, in order to use Galaxy, you must have access to a Terra Workspace with permission to compute (i.e. you must be a "Writer" or "Owner" of the Workspace).

Open your Workspace, and click on the “NOTEBOOKS” tab. Next, click on “Create a Cloud Environment for Galaxy”. You should see a popup window on the right side of the screen. Click on “NEXT” and “CREATE” to keep all settings as-is. This will take 8-10 minutes. When it is done, click “LAUNCH GALAXY”.

The notebook tab name and the plus button that starts a cloud environment for Galaxy have been highlighted," alt="Screenshot of the Workspace Notebooks tab. The notebook tab name and the plus button that starts a cloud environment for Galaxy have been highlighted," width="100%" />
::::

## Navigating Galaxy

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

Notice the three main sections.

**Tools** - These are all of the bioinformatics tool packages available for you to use.

**The Main Dashboard** - This contains flash messages and posts when you first open Galaxy, but when we are using data this is the main interface area.

**History** - When you start a project you will be able to see all of the documents in the project in the history. Now be aware, this can become very busy. Also the naming that Galaxy uses is not very intuitive, so you must make sure that you label your files with something that makes sense to you.

<img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//182AOzMaiyrreinnsRX2VhH7YsVgvAp4xtIB_7Mzmk6I_ged15532ded_0_816.png" title="Screenshot of the Galaxy landing page. The Tools and History headings have been highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Galaxy landing page. The Tools and History headings have been highlighted." width="100%" />

On the welcome page, there are links to tutorials. You may try these out on your own. If you want to try a new analysis this is a good place to start.

## Deleting Galaxy

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

Once you are done with your activity, you’ll need to shut down your Galaxy cloud environment. This frees up the cloud resources for others and minimizes computing cost. The following steps will delete your work, so make sure you are completely finished at this point. Otherwise, you will have to repeat your work from the previous steps.

Return to AnVIL, and find the Galaxy logo that shows your cloud environment is running. Click on this logo:

<img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//182AOzMaiyrreinnsRX2VhH7YsVgvAp4xtIB_7Mzmk6I_gf243efded1_0_134.png" title="Screenshot of the Workspace menu. The currently running Galaxy cloud environment logo on the top right of the page is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Workspace menu. The currently running Galaxy cloud environment logo on the top right of the page is highlighted." width="100%" />

Next, click on “DELETE ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS”:

## Touring RStudio

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

Next, we will be using RStudio and the package `Glimma` to create interactive plots. See [this vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Glimma/inst/doc/limma_edger.html) for more information.

1. The Bioconductor team has created a very useful package to programmatically interact with Terra and Google Cloud. Install the `AnVIL` package. It will make some steps easier as we go along.

    

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_49.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. You can now quickly install precompiled binaries using the AnVIL package’s `install()` function. We will use it to install the `Glimma` package and the `airway` package. The `airway` package contains a `SummarizedExperiment` data class. This data describes an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. 

{Note: for some of the packages, you will have to install packaged from the CRAN repository, using the install.packages() function. The examples will show you which install method to use.}

    

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_56.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. Load the example data.

    

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_56.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When this data is MDS transformed, the first two dimensions explain the greatest variance between samples, and the amount of variance decreases monotonically with increasing dimension. The following code will launch a new window where you can interact with the MDS plot.

    

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_70.png" title="Screenshot of the Glimma popout showing the data in an MDS plot. All data points are blue." alt="Screenshot of the Glimma popout showing the data in an MDS plot. All data points are blue." width="100%" />

1. Change the `colour_by` setting to "groups" so you can easily distinguish between groups. In this data, the "group" is the treatment.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_77.png" title="Screenshot of the Glimma popout showing the data in an MDS plot.

## Pausing RStudio

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

1. The right-hand side icon reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. If you don’t see this icon, you may need to scroll to the right.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_84.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio interface. The icon on the right showing that the cloud environment is running is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the RStudio interface. The icon on the right showing that the cloud environment is running is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on the RStudio icon and selecting “Pause”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost.  This work will be lost if the cloud environment gets deleted.  If there is anything you would like to save permanently, it's a good idea to copy it from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs.

    <img src="07-using_platforms_modules_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_91.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio menu.
